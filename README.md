# HourCache
HourCache is a hardware based time-tracking octahedron that automatically tracks activities, such as studying or socializing. When placed on a side, the HourCache starts tracking the time spent in that state and records it so that we can see exactly how our time is being spent.

Unlike the traditional time tracking method, which requires people to open a software or notebook and manually log the time spent, simply flipping the HourCache is all you need to do for tracking a variety of tasks. HourCache reduces the steps and conscious effort to track an activity. By easing the time tracking process, people are more willing to record their time usage that used to be considered as “negligible”, such as replying to messages on their phone in the middle of work. People easily get distracted and spend hours on the internet while thinking “I can reply to this message in 20 seconds”.

The data will be synced through WiFi or Bluetooth and can be visualized on any device, helping people monitor their usage habits and see exactly where their time goes.
